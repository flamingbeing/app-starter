# Notes

Lasting decisions and how to test. Shaping decisions have their own records in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/).

## How to test

See README, "Tests". The browser tests use one shared list (`spaces/_/items`), so each test uses its own made-up
accounts and item texts and checks only those; they run side by side.

## Later

- Restore from the bin (the bin entries keep the deleted version in `data`).
- Multi-group, email-link and passcode sign-in (app-devkit `custom-token.js`).
- Enforce the Content-Security-Policy (decision 0003).

## Held conflicts (app-sync 0.6.3)

`cloud.js` sets `backend.held` and `edits: '_edits'`: a same-field clash is held on the phone that made the save and
shown there as a side-by-side sheet (both versions, when in SGT, who and device); other phones see nothing to answer.
Choices are `app.resolve(c, 'mine' | 'theirs' | { field: … })`. Rules allow the `_edits` map on items.

## Files formats (`@core/files` v0, decision 0009)

Kept on the device, so a change needs a new version and a test that the old one reads as empty (`files.unit.test.mjs`).

- Upload queue, `ctx.storage()` key `<name>:files/queue`: `{ v: 1, uid, jobs: Job[] }`, Job `{ id, scope, op: 'put' |
  'delete', parts: ['file', 'thumb'?], tries, at, stuck?, rec? }` (`app/public/files/queue.js`). Another `v` reads as
  empty; an empty queue removes the key.
- Device cache, IndexedDB database `<name>-files`, store `blobs`: one Blob per key `<scope>/<id>` and
  `<scope>/<id>.thumb` (`app/public/files/cache.js`). Sign-out keeps both; a switch to another account wipes both.
- Worker: R2 bucket `<name>-files` bound as `FILES`, object key `<scope>/<id>[.thumb]` (`worker/files.js`).
